ans:for(i=5(or any value);i =i+1(or any value);i=i<\>10(or any value));


9.while loop.
ans:while(i<\>5(or any value)){}
    do{}.


10.difference between for loop and while loop.
ans:for loop:
    for loop is used for repeating the number or the word when the exact value is known.
    while loop:

ans:for(i=1;i=i+1;i<50);


14.write the code to print the even numbers 1 - 50.
ans:for(i=2;i=i+2;i<50);


15.write a code to print the lcm of two numbers.(10-20)
ans:int n1 = 10, n2 = 20, lcm;

    // maximum number between n1 and n2 is stored in lcm
   if (n1>n2) { 
      lcm=n1 ;
}
   else 
{
   lcm = n2;
}


    while(true) {
      if( lcm % n1 == 0 && lcm % n2 == 0 ) {
        print(" LCM is ", lcm);
        break;
      }
      ++lcm;
